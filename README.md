# NOAH's Corpus: Part-of-Speech Tagging for Swiss German

Swiss German is a dialect continuum of the Alemannic dialect group. It comprises numerous varieties used in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Although mainly oral varieties (_Mundarten_), they are frequently used in written communication. On the basis of their high acceptance in the Swiss culture and with the introduction of digital communication, Swiss German has undergone a spread over all kinds of communication forms and social media. Considering the lack of standard spelling rules, this leads to a huge linguistic variability because people write the way they speak. 

Such a situation is a challenging task for NLP and we would like to provide data and resources to serve as a stepping stone to automatically process texts written in these dialects. We compiled NOAH's Corpus of Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-of-Speech tags. Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speech tagger and a dialect identification model.
