# NOAH's Corpus: Part-of-Speech Tagging for Swiss German

Swiss German is a dialect continuum of the Alemannic dialect group. It comprises numerous varieties used in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Although mainly oral varieties (_Mundarten_), they are frequently used in written communication. On the basis of their high acceptance in the Swiss culture and with the introduction of digital communication, Swiss German has undergone a spread over all kinds of communication forms and social media. Considering the lack of standard spelling rules, this leads to a huge linguistic variability because people write the way they speak. 

Such a situation is a challenging task for NLP and we would like to provide data and resources to serve as a stepping stone to automatically process texts written in these dialects. We compiled NOAH's Corpus of Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-of-Speech tags. Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speech tagger and a dialect identification model.

## Original Corpus

NOAH's Corpus of Swiss German Dialects contains five XML files.
Each file contains Swiss German texts in a different text genre:
- blick.xml: newspaper articles from "Blick am Abig", Version Zurich, Nr. 97, 28. Mai 2013 [1]
- blog.xml: BlogSpot blogs, extracted 31 January, 2014 [2]
- swatch.xml: SWATCH annual report from 2012 [3]
- schobinger.xml: criminal novels by Viktor Schobinger [4]
- wiki.xml: articles from the alemannic Wikipedia [5]

### Annotations

All texts have been tokenized and manually annotated with Part-of-Speech tags. The UPOS tags were created by a mapping from STTS to UPOS.
The original tagset is described in "Compilation of a Swiss German Dialect Corpus and its Application to PoS Tagging".

### Metadata

Each article in the XML files contains a title and, where known, the dialect it is written in.

## Model (updated: Jan 2023)
