# Swiss German PoS Tagging

Swiss German is a dialect continuum whose dialects are very different from Standard German, the official language of the German speaking part of Switzerland. However, when dealing with Swiss German in Natural Language Processing, usually the detour through Standard German is taken. As writing in Swiss German has become more and more popular in recent years, we would like to provide data and resources to serve as a stepping stone to automatically process texts written in these dialects.

We compiled NOAH's Corpus of Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-of-Speech tags. Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speech tagger and a dialect identification model.
